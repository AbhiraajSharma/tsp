Simulations of various approaches to the Travelling Salesman Problem

1. Brute Force Method
2. Nearest Neighbour Method
3. Linear programming
4. Clarke-Wright Savings Algorithm

For the Clarke-Wright Savings Algorithm, run clarkeRunner.m
For the Linear Programming Implementation, run martixGenerator_forLPP.m BEFORE running solve_tsp_lpp.m.
Make sure both of them are in the same environment.
